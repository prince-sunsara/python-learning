""" 
REGULAR EXPRESSION IN PYTHON:
    > regular expression or 'regex' are a powerful tool for working with string and text data in python
    > they allows you to match and manipulate string based on patterns, making it easy to perform complex string operation with just a few line of code.

METACHARACTERS IN REGEX
    [] -> Represent a character class
    ^ -> Matches the beginning
    $ -> Matches the end of line
    . -> Matches any single character except newline
    ? -> Matches zero or one occurrence.
    * -> Matches zero or more occurrences.
    | -> means OR (matches with any of the characters separated by it.)
    + -> One or more occurrences.
    {} -> Indicate number of occurrences of a preceding RE to match
    () -> enclose a group of REs

SEARCHING FOR A PATTERN IN RE USING RE.SERACH()
